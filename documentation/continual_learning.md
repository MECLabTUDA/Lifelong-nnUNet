# Lifelong-nnUNet: Continual Learning

Lifelong-nnUNet can only be used after it has been succesfully installed *-- including all dependencies --* following [these instructions](../README.md#installation). Further, all relevant paths have to be set so that the right directories for training, preprocessing, storing etc. can be extracted. This process is described [here](setting_up_paths.md).


## Implemented Methods
This Lifelong-nnUNet Continual Learning (CL) extension provides multiple CL methods that can be used for training different models, which are introduced in the following sections.

### Sequential Training
